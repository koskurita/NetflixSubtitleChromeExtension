#  Netflix Dual Subtitle Chrome Extension

## Motivation
I'm learning Spanish and thought that it would be a great idea to have two subtitles, one in Spanish and one in English would be useful while watching shows in Spanish.
Sometimes Netflix would not offer Spanish as an option for English shows, and this would be able to bypass that.


## Setting up
1. Go to **chrome://extensions/**
2. Click on "Load Unpacked" in the top left, and select this folder
3. Once complete, this app is available in your extensions.

## How to use
1. Go to Netflix.com
2. Left click, and press translate. Choose your target language.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Side note, this chrome extension uses your browser's native translator, because google translate API costs $$. It's a little annoying but it's a workaround that works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
4. Select the chrome extension, and click on the button so it's on.
5. Now, you will have two subtitles, one in original and one in your target language.

## Functionalities to add
1. Setting for text size and color.

## Prerequisites
Chrome
